This is a **3D engine** built entirely from scratch, running directly in the **command line**. No external libraries, just **pure Python**. It was a fascinating project that pushed me to understand **3D projections**, **object rendering**, and the math behind **3D transformations**.  

## About the Project  

The engine supports **custom 3D `.obj` files** and includes **pre-made templates** to experiment with. The goal was to build a **simple but functional** 3D renderer using only text characters in Terminal.  

### Features:  
- **Supports custom `.obj` files** for full model flexibility  
- **Fully customizable rendering parameters** 
- **Pre-made 3D templates** included for quick testing  
- **No external dependencies â€“ built entirely in Python**  

## Future Improvements  
- **Performance optimizations** for smoother rendering  
- **Better shading and depth effects**  
- **More built-in 3D object templates**  

## Usage Guide  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/catab60/3D-Engine.git
   cd 3D-Engine
   ```  
2. Customize the engine settings by editing `3D_Engine.py`.
  
3. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python 3D_Engine.py
   ```  

## Learning Experience  

This project was an **amazing deep dive** into **3D rendering**, matrix transformations, and how computers simulate **3D space**. Writing everything from scratch helped me grasp how **projections, rotations, and depth processing** work at a fundamental level.
